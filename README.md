### Introduction

Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect through our Mobile App, how we use it, and what choices you have. The Mobile App is provided as a free service by Thirvusoft and is intended for use as-is. By using our service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this policy. Terms used in this privacy policy have the same meanings as those in our Terms and Conditions unless otherwise defined.

### Information Collection and Use

We collect minimal user data necessary to provide our services. Specifically:

* **Username and Password**: Collected solely for authentication purposes.
* We do not collect personally identifiable information or sensitive user data unless explicitly required for a feature.
* Our app may use third-party services that could collect information used to identify you.

### Location Information

We only access your device's location **while the app is in use**, and **only if you grant permission**. We do **not** collect or access background location data. Location access is limited to the scope necessary for check-in features or other app-specific functionality. If you deny location access, an alternative option is provided.

### Cookies

The app itself does not use cookies explicitly. However, third-party code and libraries used in the app may use cookies to collect data and enhance their services. You have the option to accept or refuse cookies.
